# UFOs
## Project Overview 
Creating a webpage for Dana that contains a dynamic table with multiple criteria filters which allow for searches for UFO sightings across the United States.

## Resources
Software: Google Chrome Web Browser, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2

## Results 
When entering the web page, the filter search options are shown on the bottom left. There are multiple criteria for searches which will filter the results based on the user's inputs. When the input searches are removed, the full default data is shown again.

## Summary 
* One drawback when using the webpage is that all the data is displayed upon entering which can be quite long to scroll down to view. 
* A recommendation to enhance the webpage could be to add a "display all data" button to only show all the data when prompted as viewers may not want to see everything displayed all at once.
* Another recommendation would be to display a message that would say "no results to show" when there is no data that meets the search criteria.
